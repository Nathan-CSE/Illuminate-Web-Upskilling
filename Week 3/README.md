# Week 3 Exercise

This week's exercise is to translate a landing page prototype into a webpage built with React.

This mockup was designed by Saber Ali, Najmul Hasan and Tahsinul Mahmud and can be found at https://www.behance.net/gallery/118083883/Ecommerce-UI-Kit-%28Free-Download%29.

I have created a modified version of it which you can access here: https://www.figma.com/file/jGK8akSFOoVMjWljxfPobr/Project---Hekto?node-id=1%3A38.

You will be specifically recreating the Home Page (up until the marked point). The React starter app has already been set up for you in the `hekto` folder. Remember to run `npm i` to install the required dependencies then `npm start` to start the development server. 

I've also provided the images (i.e. the furniture) that you'll need in the `hekto/public/images` folder. 
Hint: The `src` attribute would be 'http://localhost:3000/images/imageName'.
